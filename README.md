### gcnn experiments reimplementation using Tensorflow
* We reimplemented Z2CNN, P4CNN, P4MCNN and P4CNN\_RP for MNIST\_ROT dataset.
* See `my_gconv_exps/MNIST_ROT/models_tp.py` for detailed usage.
* Also we add a chainer version P4MCNN model, which is not presented in the original paper. 
It performs better than the Z2CNN on mnist rotation dataset.
